# Router
A simple web application that recommends places of interest given a route. You can also favourite your routes to lesser the time taken to search again!

# Motivation
Despite Google Maps being incredibly useful, it cannot recommend places of interest along a route, it can only recommend places near your current location. So we thought, it would be handy to know what restaurant are there along the way from place A to place B! Google Maps has indeed tried to implement this and their defunct library is the base of our web app!
